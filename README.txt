Common Problems:
"Synapse X not popping up when launched"
Run as administrator and it will probably be loaded!

"Synapse X crashes/freezes when injected"
It's probably because you dont have WebView2 downloaded (which you can download at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703), but if it still doesn't work, try getting a better pc, sorry!

"Synapse X still not loading after launched using administrator"
